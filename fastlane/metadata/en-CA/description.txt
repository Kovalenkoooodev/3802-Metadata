Dive into a golden world of risk, rewards, and smart choices in Relics & Runs, a fast-paced organizer roguelike where every decision matters. You play as a daring adventurer racing through ancient locations, grabbing valuable relics and trying to pack them all into your backpack before time runs out.

Each run is split into two tense phases. First, you choose items from limited offers, weighing rarity, value, and space. Then comes the real challenge: fitting everything into your grid-based backpack. Rotate items, plan ahead, and decide what’s worth keeping—because anything that doesn’t fit is left behind. Hit Escape in time and you cash out. Miss it, and you lose it all.

Earn coins from successful runs and invest them into permanent upgrades. Expand your inventory with new shapes and slots, unlock powerful skills like rerolls, locks, and banishes, or increase your luck to find rarer loot. Daily bonuses, achievements, and multiple environments keep every run fresh and unpredictable.

Easy to learn but deeply strategic, Relics & Runs blends satisfying inventory puzzles with roguelike progression. Pack smart, upgrade wisely, and see how far your next run can take you.
